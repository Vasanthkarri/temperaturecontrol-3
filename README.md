In this project I learned about useState hook, we can set intial value in useState("");
The main use of useState Hook is initial is set in one variable and it will update with other variable or function.
EX:const[temperatureValue, setTemperatureValue] = useState(10);
And when temperature is 30 degrees it is the maximum value and returns
we have to use{useState} hook from impoting from React.
